<p>Hey, I'm Mandy Chen <br>  I am a current student in San Jose University.

   <h1 id="title">Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>As a digital media artist, I am interested in nature, animals, humans, live and death. Most of my arts are created through illustration, video art, procreate, and photographs to let people have a deeper understanding of what I or others’ emotions.

My favorite project is “Simpsons”( Video art, 2020), I created a video that used Simspons gif. The purpose of the video is to make people happy because being happy will make people feel better and have positive emotions. The other project called “Joker” ( Gif, 2019), combined three of the Jokers from a different time period together in one scene. As a movie, Joker also gives us a deep impression of our negative side in this society, what we been through and what others did can do harm to us. 

Humanity is a topic that I am also interested in because it included our emotions and desire. Sometimes, our emotions and desire can create positive things, but sometimes we created negativities which can harm the others.
